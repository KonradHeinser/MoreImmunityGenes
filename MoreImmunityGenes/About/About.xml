This mod adds 4 new immunity genes, super weak, very weak, below average, and hyper immunity. They provide more options in immunity gains, with their related effects being 50%, 75%, 95%, and 200% immunity gain speed. 

If you are using AlphaGenes, the very weak immunity from this mod will replace the one from that mod. The only differences between the two are that this one has a slightly higher genetic complexity, while theirs has a much higher art complexity. This should be compatible with every other gene mod, but let me know if you encounter an issue.
